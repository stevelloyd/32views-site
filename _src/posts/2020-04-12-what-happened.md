I originally launched this project over a year ago, and hoped to be well underway by now, but sometimes 'best laid plans'...

<!-- more -->

...and I just wasn't able to spend the time I needed on the project last year. But, looking on the bright side of the postponement, there have been some developments which are useful in beginning this:

* there's a new Raspberry Pi---the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B which makes running Racket even snappier; with more memory (2 or 4GB)
* the popular Pi operating system [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) has been updated with a newer version of Racket in its package catalogue (now 7.2)---it is possible to install the very latest version of Racket, something we'll do later
* deliberations on what additional hardware to recommend to get started with 'physical computing'[^physical comp] on the Pi have been resolved by the availability of the 'York Pi Jam'[JAM Hat](https://thepihut.com/products/jam-hat).

[^physical comp]: Interacting with the 'real' world from the Pi---lights, switches, sensors.
