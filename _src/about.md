# About 

So, you’re looking at something called 32 views of computing—with Racket and Raspberry Pi.

32 views for short.

## What is 32 views…?

It’s a series of projects, in which we’ll learn together using a programming language called Racket, running on the small, affordable Raspberry Pi computer. [^pi]

[^pi]: Raspberry Pi is a trademark of the Raspberry Pi Foundation.

The idea of the projects will be to interact with the real world (flashing lights, sensing environmental parameters such as temperature) and presenting the information sensed. Along the way we’ll pick up some general computing skills.

The projects will be released in instalments.

## Why the name ‘32 views…‘?

I was looking for a theme to bring these set of projects together. Then last year I went to an exhibition of the work of Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai; which gave me an idea.

A bit of history…in about 1830, Hokusai and his daughter Ōi created a series of prints called [36 views of Mount Fuji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-six_Views_of_Mount_Fuji). They were published in groups over a number of months, and made use of new materials available to Japanese artists economically for the first time (for example, the pigment Berlin Blue).

For the price of a bowl of noodles, anyone could buy a print in the series; the most famous of which is *The Great Wave*.

I’ve co-opted Hokusai-sensei’s publishing idea–hence 32 views of computing. I like the multiple views notion, because it provides both me, and you, reader with small, hopefully approachable chunks to digest. And ‘32’ because computers like [powers of two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_two)!

## Why Racket?

The Raspberry Pi is powerful enough to support seriously capable programming tools---Python is rightly of course incredibly popular, but is only one of many systems which can be used on it; all available for the price of a couple of minutes of your time installing them.

If programming languages are the computing equivalent of a Swiss Army Knife (™ Victorinox AG), Racket is like having a Swiss Army Knife factory. Experiencing it is well worth your time and effort, even (especially) if you plan to use other languages mostly. Though I hope at the end of this, you'll want to keep it on your toolbelt.

## Why the Raspberry Pi?

Since it was released in 2012, the Pi---(we’ll call it that from now on) has created one of the most vibrant maker communities around, so there’s plenty of support available. There is a huge market of add-ons for it (some of which we’ll be using in our projects), and it provides just the right amount of power, for just the right amount of money. And once you’ve worked through these projects, you can re-purpose your Pi as an internet radio, a robot, a Homekit accessory, or any one of a myriad of projects (see issues of [MagPi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/) magazine for ideas). Or indeed, a perfectly capable desktop computer (the latest version will happily drive two 4K monitors)!
